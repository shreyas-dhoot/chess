Chess is a popular game played by everyone. This is an implementation of a 2 player chess which has a simple and easy to use interface. 

What is working?
-> Displays chessboard.
-> Inputs a white chess piece to be moved (small or in caps).
->checks if it is invalid or not.
-> Inputs chess move.
-> Generates and print all the possible moves (if not possible then -1) of the entered chess piece and checks if chess move is valid or not.
Rest under development.
